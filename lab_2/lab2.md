It's very important to have a liscense for several reasons. For one reason if you don't have a liscense everything is proprietary and copyrighted so noone can use your work for free. In addition if you don't have the correct liscense then people (possibly who are more experienced) can't help develop and imporve your software at all :(.

It is very important not to use unliscensed code someone else made. In the u.s work is by default proprietary and all rights reserved so if you use their work you are illegaly stealing it. Thus you can be sued and that is not a fun experience.

3) 
I think it varies. I do like the idea of having many people working on the code to better improve it faster, but it's also possible that I want to define the "right thing" depending on my purpose. For example if I am primarily developing it for my company to use, I'm going to want it to be compatible with what my company is using already to minimize costs of incorporating the technology in the future.

4) 
there are many many reasons why GPL was chosen for Linux. Of them I would say a chief reason was the climate and reason for linux's development. The hacker movement. This was a time when people wanted free and open source projects and with BSD or MIT liscense it couldn't be guarenteed that future derivates would be free, but the GPL guarenteed that as soon as your code was distributed it too would be GPL thus allowing you to ensure that your code would be free and open source too.

6) 
For the common good I would say a GPL liscense is the best. It forces you to make your changes public if you want to distribute them which allows the community as a whole to benefit. For a developer I would say an apache/bsd is rather nice and definitely not for a commerical company. The apache liscense allows anyone to work on your stuff and provides experienced developers and companies incentive to use and develop your code b/c they are getting something out of it too. Then they contribute back because it's helping them too. Finally a company would likely want an LGPL or GPL to seperate the proprietary code from the open source, or to simply make it so that everyone will contribute back if they want to distribute theirs making it so noone can take your work spin it off and profit without you being able to take that work too and work on your own.
