It's very important to have a liscense for several reasons. For one reason if you don't have a liscense everything is proprietary and copyrighted so noone can use your work for free. In addition if you don't have the correct liscense then people (possibly who are more experienced) can't help develop and imporve your software at all :(.

It is very important not to use unliscensed code someone else made. In the u.s work is by default proprietary and all rights reserved so if you use their work you are illegaly stealing it. Thus you can be sued and that is not a fun experience.
