It's very important to have a liscense for several reasons. For one reason if you don't have a liscense everything is proprietary and copyrighted so noone can use your work for free. In addition if you don't have the correct liscense then people (possibly who are more experienced) can't help develop and imporve your software at all :(.

It is very important not to use unliscensed code someone else made. In the u.s work is by default proprietary and all rights reserved so if you use their work you are illegaly stealing it. Thus you can be sued and that is not a fun experience.

I think it varies. I do like the idea of having many people working on the code to better improve it faster, but it's also possible that I want to define the "right thing" depending on my purpose. For example if I am primarily developing it for my company to use, I'm going to want it to be compatible with what my company is using already to minimize costs of incorporating the technology in the future.
